# Docker Container Updater

For all the lazier and automation-loving nerds, constantly updating Docker containers can be a tedious chore. Enter the Docker Container Updater to save the day. It handles updates without relying on the "latest" tag or sticking to the current image tag, which might cause you to miss important updates. Instead, it plays by your rules!

## Features

- **üîÑ Automated Container Updates**: Effortlessly update all your Docker containers on your host under your own conditions.
- **üß† Smart Update Detection**: This tool creates a regex filter based on the currently used image tag and scans Docker Hub for any available updates. It automatically analyzes the version numbers specified in the image tags and identifies major, minor, patch, and build updates. It also handles simple digest updates automatically.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable and Conditional Update Rules**: Define highly precise update rules for each individual container.
- **üîÅ Standard Update Sequence**: Updates follow the standard sequence: first digest, build, patch, minor, and then major updates. No updates are skipped.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Backup and Rollback**: Backups of your containers are created before updates. If an update fails, the change is rolled back and the old container is restarted.
- **üìß Notifications**: Stay informed with detailed email and telegram reports
- **üìú Pre- and Post-Scripts Integration**: Integrate your own pre- and post-scripts to perform actions such as backing up configuration files or databases before any update and making adjustments to the container configuration after any update.

## Getting Started

### Choose your method
Here are three methods to get this tool up and running:
1. [Method: Using the Docker image](#1-method-using-the-docker-image)
   - [Docker CLI](#using-docker-cli)
   - [Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose)
2. [Method: Directly on your Docker host as a normal Bash script executed by root](#2-method-run-this-script-directly-on-your-host)
3. [Method: Cloning this repository and building your own image](#3-method-build-your-own-docker-image)

### 1. Method: Using the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/janjk/docker-container-updater)

> This method allows you to run a simple and dedicated Docker container that already includes all the necessary tools required by `container_update.sh`.

#### Using Docker CLI

##### Example Command

```bash
docker run  -d \
            --name=Docker-Container-Updater \
            --hostname=Docker-Container-Updater \
            --restart=always \
            --privileged \
            --tty \
            --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
            --mount type=bind,source=/etc/localtime,target=/etc/localtime,readonly \
            --env DCU_TEST_MODE=true \
            --env DCU_UPDATE_RULES='*[0.1.1-1,true]' \
            janjk/docker-container-updater:latest
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The default configuration has **test mode enabled** *(even if you not specify the variable `DCU_TEST_MODE`)*. Safety first üòâ! After you've run your first test, checked for errors, and reviewed the generated Docker run commands, you can disable test mode in your configuration file *(see [Configuration](#configuration))*.

##### Data Persistence

To ensure data persistence, you should configure the following mounts:

```
--mount type=bind,source=<YOUR_LOCAL_PRE_SCRIPTS_PATH>,target=/usr/local/etc/container_update/pre-scripts \
--mount type=bind,source=<YOUR_LOCAL_POST_SCRIPTS_PATH>,target=/usr/local/etc/container_update/post-scripts \
--mount type=bind,source=<YOUR_LOCAL_LOGS_PATH>,target=/var/log \
```

##### Notifications

#### Using Docker Compose

1. Download the `docker-compose-example.yaml`
2. Rename `docker-compose-example.yaml` to `docker-compose.yaml`
   ```bash
   mv ./docker-compose-example.yaml ./docker-compose.yaml
   ```
3. Customize your `docker-compose.yaml` according to your needs
4. run  `docker-compose up -d`
   
### 2. Method: Run this script directly on your host

1. On your Docker host, navigate to the directory where the script `container_update.sh` should be downloaded
2. Download `container_update.sh` and make it executable _(this can be done manually or by using the following command):_
   ```bash
   wget --header='Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' -O container_update.sh https://api.github.com/repos/jansppenrade2/Docker-Container-Updater/contents/container_update.sh?ref=main && chmod +x ./container_update.sh
   ```
3. Execute `./container_update.sh` with root privileges *(the first run will be in **test mode** and will also create the default configuration file)*
4. Customize the default configuration file according to your specific requirements *(see [Configuration](#configuration))*
5. Create a cron job for this script *(after testing ü´†)*

### 3. Method: Build your own Docker image

1. Clone this repository and navigate to it's folder
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jansppenrade2/Docker-Container-Updater.git
   cd Docker-Container-Updater/
   ```
2. Build the container
   ```bash
   docker build -t docker_container_updater:latest -f ./DOCKERFILE .
   ```
   Or behind a corporate proxy:
   ```bash
   docker build -t docker_container_updater:latest \
   --build-arg http_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128 \ 
   --build-arg https_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128 \ 
   -f ./DOCKERFILE .
   ```
3. Rename `docker-compose-example.yaml` to `docker-compose.yaml`
   ```bash
   mv ./docker-compose-example.yaml ./docker-compose.yaml
   ```
5. Customize your `docker-compose.yaml`
6. Start the setup with the command `docker compose up -d`
7. Update the setup with
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### How it works

‚ÑπÔ∏è After successfully starting the `Docker Container Updater`, a cron job inside the container will automatically manage the update mechanism for your Docker containers based on the cron expression defined in `DCU_CRONTAB_EXECUTION_EXPRESSION`.

If you want to manually execute the task, you can just run:
```
docker exec -it Docker-Container-Updater ./container_update.sh
```

## Configuration

The Docker Container Updater utilizes a configuration file, by default located in `/usr/local/etc/container_update/container_update.ini`. This file contains all the settings and parameters necessary for `container_update.sh` to run. You have the flexibility to tailor the configuration file to your specific needs when executing `container_update.sh` directly on your Docker host. Alternatively, when opting to utilize the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/janjk/docker-container-updater), you can simply add the corresponding environment variables to your `docker run` command.

### Update Rules

The `update_rules` parameter, or `DCU_UPDATE_RULES` environment variable allows you to define the update behavior for your containers. The default rule is `*[0.1.1-1,true]`, which means:

- `*`: Applies to all containers.
- `0.1.1-1`: Specifies the update policy, where each number represents:
  - `0`: Major updates *(0 means no major updates, 1 means allow major updates to the next available, 2 means always stay one version behind the latest major release, and so on)*
  - `1`: Minor updates *(0 means no minor updates, 1 means allow minor updates to the next available, 2 means always stay one version behind the latest minor release, and so on)*
  - `1`: Patch updates *(0 means no patch updates, 1 means allow patch updates to the next available, 2 means always stay one version behind the latest patch release, and so on)*
  - `1`: Build updates *(0 means no build updates, 1 means allow build updates to the next available, 2 means always stay one version behind the latest build release, and so on)*
- `true`: Indicates that digest updates are allowed.

You can customize these rules for each container by specifying different patterns and update policies separated by spaces.

#### Basic Rule Example

```
*[0.1.1-1,true] mycontainer[1.0.0-1,true] another[0.0.1-1,false] further[2.1.1-1,true]
```

> This example configuration means:
>
> - All containers are allowed to apply only minor, patch, build, and digest updates.
> - The container named `mycontainer` is allowed to apply major, build, and digest updates.
> - The container named `another` is allowed to apply only patch and build updates.
> - The container named `further` is allowed to apply build updates only when the latest release is two versions higher *(e.g., if Nextcloud releases version 29.0.0 and your Nextcloud is on version 27.0.0, an update to version 28.0.0 will be performed)*.

#### Precise Rule Examples

You can also create more specific rule sets that allow, for example, major updates for a container if at least one patch has been released for that major version.
In the rules, 'M' stands for Major, 'm' for Minor, 'p' for Patch, and 'b' for Build.

```
mycontainer[1&(p>1).1.1-1,true]
```

> This rule allows major updates for the container `mycontainer` if at least one patch version greater than 1 has been released for this major version.

```
mycontainer[0.1(b>2).1-1,true]
```

> This rule allows minor updates for the container `mycontainer` if the build version is greater than 2.

These precise rules provide granular control over the update behavior of specific containers based on various conditions such as patch versions, build versions, and more.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è These rules do not affect the order in which updates are installed! An update is never skipped.

### Pre- and Post-Scripts

To give you more control, you can integrate pre- and post-scripts. These are created by default in the directories `/usr/local/etc/container_update/pre-scripts` and `/usr/local/etc/container_update/post-scripts`, and they must be named after the container. These are standard shell scripts that you can create and customize as needed. For example, you can create backups of databases, configuration files, etc., before updating a container, and make adjustments such as customized branding or changes to file permissions after the update. Essentially, you can tailor these scripts to your specific needs. The output of these scripts is redirected to the log located in `/var/log/container_update.log` by default, so you have all logs in one place.

### Notifications

#### 1. E-Mail Notifications

##### General Information

If you are running the `container_update.sh` script directly on your Docker host, you just need to ensure that `sendmail` is installed and configured on your Docker host.
If you are using the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/janjk/docker-container-updater), you need to have a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) (e.g., Postfix) installed, configured and reachable in your network, to which the Docker container can relay its emails. The IP address or the hostname of your MTA needs be specified in the environment variable `DCU_MAIL_RELAYHOST` when running the container.
